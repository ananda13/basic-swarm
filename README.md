# Swarm Simulation

### Runs locally on Windows/Mac


A small swarm simulation built in Unity.

For a tutorial on how to scale this up to using massive swarms, running in the cloud, on top of SpatialOS, refer to [this tutorial](https://github.com/ananda13/swarm/)

This was compiled on a Mac, and you may have to change the build settings in Unity for other platforms.
